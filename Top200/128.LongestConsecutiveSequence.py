    #Because a sequence could start at any number in nums,
    #  we can exhaust the entire search space by building as long a 
    # sequence as possible from every numbers

    #we only attempt to build sequences from numbers that 
    # are not already part of a longer sequence. This is accomplished 
    # by first ensuring that the number that would immediately precede 
    # the current number in a sequence is not present, as that numberÃŸ
    #  would necessarily be part of a longer sequence.

    #We traverse each number at most 2 times
