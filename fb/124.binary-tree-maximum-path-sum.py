#
# A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent
# nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in
# the sequence at most once. Note that the path does not need to pass through
# the root.
# 
# The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.
# 
# Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any path.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [1,2,3]
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 =
# 6.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
# Output: 42
# Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7
# = 42.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3 * 10^4].
# -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
#
