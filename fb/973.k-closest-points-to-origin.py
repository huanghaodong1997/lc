#
# Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the
# X-Y plane and an integer k, return the k closest points to the origin (0,
# 0).
# 
# The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance
# (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2).
# 
# You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique
# (except for the order that it is in).
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
# Output: [[-2,2]]
# Explanation:
# The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
# The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
# Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
# We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just
# [[-2,2]].
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
# Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
# Explanation: The answer [[-2,4],[3,3]] would also be accepted.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= k <= points.length <= 10^4
# -10^4 < xi, yi < 10^4
